# 📊 E-Commerce SQL Case Study

Welcome to my **E-Commerce Analytics SQL Case Study**, a real-world project that demonstrates how I extract actionable insights from structured relational databases to drive key business decisions.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The dataset used in this project is confidential and **cannot be shared or disclosed**, as it falls under a signed **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**.

## 🔍 Project Overview

As a **Data Analyst**, I was tasked with uncovering insights from a comprehensive e-commerce database to support multiple business verticals including:

* 📈 **Sales Optimization**
* 🛍️ **Product Performance Analysis**
* 🤝 **Customer Insights**
* 📦 **Inventory Management**

The analysis was performed using **pure MySQL**, simulating the kind of high-impact, data-driven queries used at companies like Meesho, Airbnb, and Amazon.

## 🧠 What I Did

I explored and solved **50+ business-critical questions**, gradually increasing in difficulty from basic metrics to advanced cohort, RFM, and CLTV modeling.

✅ Sample questions tackled:

* What are the top-selling products by revenue and quantity?
* Which customer segment has the highest retention?
* What are the cross-sell opportunities based on purchase behavior?
* Which locations drive the highest customer lifetime value?
* Forecasting next month’s revenue using trailing averages.

📂 Dataset Structure :

* `Customers`: customer\_id, name, location
* `Products`: product\_id, name, category, price
* `Orders`: order\_id, order\_date, customer\_id, total\_amount
* `OrderDetails`: order\_id, product\_id, quantity, price\_per\_unit
